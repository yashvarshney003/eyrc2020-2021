# Task 0:
10 questions on code chef platform consist 5 question in <b> PYTHON </b> and 5 in <b> LUA</b>
Completed on 16/10/2020<br>
Aman Tyagi : 4 question<br>
Anurag Saxena : 2 question<br>
Yash Varshney : 4 Question<br>



# Task1 :
1a>Task is to find out the following details for each image in the manner as shown below:

Detect all the non-white shapes in the images.
Store the details of the these detected shapes in a dictionary in the same order as mentioned below in form of key:value pair, where key is a string in single quotation marks and value is an array of details.
{ 'Shape': ['color', Area, cX, cY] }
<br>


1b>For Task_1A_Part2, you are provided with two video files namely ballmotion.m4v and ballmotionwhite.m4v. In both these videos, there is a red circle moving in frame inside a maze.
<br>


1c> Use OpenCV techniques to detect the maze in the above given image and convert it into a 2D maze array with appropriate Cell Numbers

# Task2 :
(1) Task 2A
This task is based on Image Processing using Vision Sensors in CoppeliaSim.<br>
Teams should apply the concepts learnt in Task 1A and 1B and build a Python Remote API file to find the correct Shape, Color, Centroid X and Centroid Y of the ball(s) in the dynamic CoppeliaSim scene using a Vision Sensor.<br>


(2) Task 2B<br>
This task is based on maze generation in CoppeliaSim using the output of Task 1B.<br>
Teams should use python remote API to transmit the encoded maze array (output of task 1b) to a Lua script in CoppeliaSim scene to generate walls of the maze.<br>
