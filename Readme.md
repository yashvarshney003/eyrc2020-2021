# Task1 :
1a>Task is to find out the following details for each image in the manner as shown below:

Detect all the non-white shapes in the images.
Store the details of the these detected shapes in a dictionary in the same order as mentioned below in form of key:value pair, where key is a string in single quotation marks and value is an array of details.
{ 'Shape': ['color', Area, cX, cY] }
<br>


1b>For Task_1A_Part2, you are provided with two video files namely ballmotion.m4v and ballmotionwhite.m4v. In both these videos, there is a red circle moving in frame inside a maze.
<br>


1c> Use OpenCV techniques to detect the maze in the above given image and convert it into a 2D maze array with appropriate Cell Numbers

# Task2 :
(1) Task 2A
This task is based on Image Processing using Vision Sensors in CoppeliaSim.<br>
Teams should apply the concepts learnt in Task 1A and 1B and build a Python Remote API file to find the correct Shape, Color, Centroid X and Centroid Y of the ball(s) in the dynamic CoppeliaSim scene using a Vision Sensor.<br>


(2) Task 2B<br>
This task is based on maze generation in CoppeliaSim using the output of Task 1B.<br>
Teams should use python remote API to transmit the encoded maze array (output of task 1b) to a Lua script in CoppeliaSim scene to generate walls of the maze.<br>

# Task3 :
In this task we were asked to design PID algorithm to balance the ball on table at particular co-ordinate.<br>
We changed our designed from four servo motor to two servo holder to reduce mathmatical complexity and programming complexity.
we don't get enough time to work more efficiently on this task but we gave our 100%.
But other teams performed well from us and got more marks because thier control logic is more efficient than our's.
